<h2>Trees</h2>
<p><i>tnt.tree</i> creates a new tree visualization. There are several components that need to be set up in this visualization. One is the tree object to display (<i>tree.data</i> method). You can obtain a valid tree object directly from <i>newick</i> or <i>nhx</i> formats through <i>tnt.tree.parse_newick</i> or <i>tnt.tree.parse_nhx</i> respectively, or you can pass a javascript object with a tree structure. TnT converts this tree object into a <i>tnt.tree.tree</i> object to allow some tree manipulation methods to be used on the tree structure. For example:</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var newick = '((human, chimp),mouse)';
var tree_vis = tnt.tree()
              .data(tnt.tree.parse_newick(newick));
var tree = tree.tree();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the snippet above, <i>tree_vis</i> is the tree visualization object, <i>tree</i> is a tree object with different methods on nodes to search, apply, etc... Both types of objects (tree visualizations and tree objects) have their own set of methods. See below for all the methods available for each type of object (expect for tree_objects which are pure</p>
